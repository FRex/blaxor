# Blaxor
A small hex viewer. Work in progress. Works on both Windows and Linux.
**I don't recommend using it yet unless you're up for a challenege.**
If you're interested but can't/don't want to build it or want to know all the
controls then let me know in an issue here. If you want to look for the keys to
do search, switch to binary and upper/lowercase hex display, change font size,
etc. yourself they are all/mostly in `int BlaHexDisplay::handle(int event)`.

Uses:
1. [FLTK 1.3.5](https://www.fltk.org) (external dependency, not included in this repo).
2. [UTF-8 DFA decoder](http://bjoern.hoehrmann.de/utf-8/decoder/dfa/) (fully in `utf8dfa.hpp` and `utf8dfa.cpp`).

Written for fun, to get familiar with **FLTK** (a C++ GUI library I once saw
used in one game mod's config utility) and for my own use because it's hard
to find a simple, light, good and free hex viewer/editor. **Blaxor** is not an
editor yet (just a viewer) but it *might* be one in the future.

I use [XVI32](http://www.chmaas.handshake.de/delphi/freeware/xvi32/xvi32.htm)
and it's good and simple program but it has a few shortcomings I ran into too.
It doesn't seem to handle non-ASCII Unicode filenames (an error message with
garbled filename pops up), it's freeware but closed source, Windows only with a
license that forbids reverse engineering and modification. It also seems to
load entire file (or big part of it) into memory, taking seconds to load a few
GB file off of a HDD and for files starting at about 5 GB it'll just display an
error message about not being able to allocate memory (probably since it's a
32-bit program). I specifically avoid all these problems in **Blaxor**.
